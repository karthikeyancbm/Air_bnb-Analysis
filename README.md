# **Airbnb-Analysis**
* This is an open-source project repo which deals with extracting data from Airbnb dataset available in MongoDB Atlas as a sample dataset, pre-processing and loading it into a CSV file for visualization. 
* EDA is done using Streamlit along with Plotly charts. Also, an interactive dashboard is built using Tableau and Plotly.

## **Introduction:**
* Airbnb, is an American San Francisco-based company operating an online marketplace for short-term and long-term homestays and experiences.
* The company acts as a broker and charges a commission from each booking.
* This project aims at Extracting, Cleaning, Performing the EDA, Visualizing it using Streamlit and Creating an interactive Power BI Dashboard. The dataset is available in the MongoDB Atlas as a Sample Dataset.

# **Technology Stack:**
1. Python scripting
2. NoSQL - MongoDB Atlas
3. Streamlit App development
4. Data Pre-processing
5. Plotly
6. seaborn
7. Matplotlib
8. Tableau

# **Usage:**
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run the streamlit application using streamlit run filepath.\Air_bnb.py
3. View the portal in your localhost

# **Data Uploading and the Extraction:**
1. Upload the sample dataset into MongoDb using mongodb insert query.
2. Login to the MongoDb Atlas portal
3. Choose "Browse Collections"
4. From the list of collections, select sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews
5. Explore the dataset available
6. Extract the data

# **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
* Split the dataset into separate table, so that we can get a clear understanding.
* Handling null values, Normalization, duplicates removal,duplicate columns removal and converting the categorical to numerical values (whereever necessary) are performed.

# **Visualization and Exploration:**
* The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is done using Streamlit Application with the help of the below mentioned packages.
* Plotly Charts / Plots - Building interactive charts and plots.
* seaborn

# **Dashboard Creation:**
* An interactive dashboard reports are generated and filtered through a Tableau.
* View the dashboard using the link mentioned below.
* Tableau link: [https://public.tableau.com/views/AirbnbAnalysisDashboard2/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karthikeyan.m2180/vizzes)


# **Further Improvements:**
The project can further be enhanced by building models to predict the hosts preferences based on seasons and availabilities. This will help us to better understand and recommend to the hosts accordingly.
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to reach out.
